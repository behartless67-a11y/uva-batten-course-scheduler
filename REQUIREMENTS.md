## Soft Constraints (PREFERENCES - SHOULD BE SATISFIED WHEN POSSIBLE)

These constraints should be honored when possible but can be violated if necessary:

### 1. Faculty Preferences
- Faculty preferred days and times should be honored when possible
- Faculty avoid days/times should be respected when possible

### 2. Course Distribution
- **Core courses:** Each core should include at least one morning (before 12 PM) and one afternoon (after 12 PM) offering

- **Same-day discussions:** When possible, all discussion sections for a lecture should meet on the same day

### 4. Section Balance

## Room Assignment Priority

Rooms should be assigned in the following priority order:

1. **Dell (60 capacity):** Large lectures, single-section core courses
2. **Rouss Hall (48 capacity):** Medium-sized courses, multi-section core courses
3. **Pavilion VIII (18 capacity):** Small electives, capstones (15-20 students)
4. **UREG Assigned:** Everything else (registrar assigns)

### Special Room Rules
- If only one section of a core course is offered, it **must** be placed in a large lecture hall (Dell)
