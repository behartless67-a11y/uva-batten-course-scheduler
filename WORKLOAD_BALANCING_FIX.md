## Problem Summary

### Initial Observation

After running AI auto-resolve on a test schedule, the Faculty Schedule Summary showed:

**Severe Workload Imbalance:**
- **Andy Pennock:** 7 courses (17.8 hours/week)
- **8 Faculty Members:** 0 courses each (0.0 hours/week)
- **4 Faculty Members:** 1-2 courses each (2.7-5.3 hours/week)

**Impact:**
- Unfair distribution of teaching responsibilities
- Potential burnout for overloaded faculty
- Underutilization of available faculty resources
- Not sustainable for production use

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Initial Hypothesis:** AI auto-resolve was causing the imbalance
2. **Finding:** AI auto-resolve scoring had weak workload penalty (-5 pts per course)
3. **Deeper Investigation:** Imbalance existed BEFORE auto-resolve ran
4. **Root Cause:** Initial schedule generation blindly copied facultyId from CSV

### The Real Problem

**File:** `lib/scheduling/scheduler.ts`
**Method:** `createSectionsFromCourses()`
**Line 121:** `facultyId: course.facultyId`

```typescript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN)
this.courses.forEach(course => {
  for (let i = 0; i < course.numberOfSections; i++) {
    sections.push({
      id: `${course.id}-section-${i + 1}`,
      courseId: course.id,
      sectionNumber: i + 1,
      facultyId: course.facultyId, // ❌ No intelligence here!
      // ...
    });
  }
});
```

**Why This Caused Problems:**
- CSV file listed "Andy Pennock" for multiple multi-section courses
- Scheduler just copied that assignment for ALL sections
- No consideration for workload balance
- Result: One faculty gets everything assigned in CSV

---

## Solutions Implemented

We implemented **TWO** fixes to address both the root cause and symptom:

### Fix #1: AI Auto-Resolve Workload Scoring (Symptom)

**File:** `components/scheduling/ConflictResolutionWizard.tsx`
**Commit:** `205f2d8`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD: Weak penalty
const currentAssignments = sections.filter(s => s.facultyId === faculty.id).length;
score -= currentAssignments * 5; // Only -5 per course!

// NEW: Exponential penalty
if (currentAssignments === 0) score -= 0;        // 100+ pts
else if (currentAssignments === 1) score -= 15;  // 85 pts
else if (currentAssignments === 2) score -= 30;  // 70 pts
else if (currentAssignments === 3) score -= 50;  // 50 pts
else score -= 75;                                // 25 pts (4+)
```

**Impact:**
- Improved conflict resolution suggestions
- Prevents AI auto-resolve from making imbalance worse
- But doesn't fix initial generation problem

---

### Fix #2: AI-Powered Initial Workload Balancing (ROOT CAUSE)

**File:** `lib/scheduling/scheduler.ts`
**Commit:** `2db1443`

**Changes:**

#### 1. Added Workload Tracking

```typescript
private createSectionsFromCourses(): Partial<ScheduledSection>[] {
  const sections: Partial<ScheduledSection>[] = [];
  const facultyWorkload = new Map<string, number>(); // Track assignments

  // Initialize tracker
  this.faculty.forEach(f => facultyWorkload.set(f.id, 0));

  this.courses.forEach(course => {
    for (let i = 0; i < course.numberOfSections; i++) {
      let assignedFacultyId = course.facultyId;

      // 🎯 AI-powered workload balancing
      if (this.config.balanceWorkload && course.facultyId) {
        assignedFacultyId = this.selectBestFaculty(course, facultyWorkload);
      }

      sections.push({
        // ... section config
        facultyId: assignedFacultyId, // ✅ Intelligently assigned!
      });

      // Update workload tracker
      if (assignedFacultyId) {
        facultyWorkload.set(
          assignedFacultyId,
          (facultyWorkload.get(assignedFacultyId) || 0) + 1
        );
      }
    }
  });

  return sections;
}
```

#### 2. Added Smart Faculty Selection

```typescript
private selectBestFaculty(
  course: Course,
  currentWorkload: Map<string, number>
): string {
  const originalFaculty = this.faculty.find(f => f.id === course.facultyId);
  if (!originalFaculty) return course.facultyId;

  // Find eligible faculty (not overloaded)
  const eligibleFaculty = this.faculty.filter(f => {
    const workload = currentWorkload.get(f.id) || 0;
    return workload < 4; // ❌ Hard cap at 4 courses
  });

  if (eligibleFaculty.length === 0) return course.facultyId;

  // Score each faculty member
  const scoredFaculty = eligibleFaculty.map(f => {
    let score = 100;

    // DOMINANT FACTOR: Workload balance
    const workload = currentWorkload.get(f.id) || 0;
    if (workload === 0) score -= 0;       // ✅ Prefer unassigned
    else if (workload === 1) score -= 20;
    else if (workload === 2) score -= 40;
    else if (workload === 3) score -= 65;
    else score -= 90;

    // BONUS: Original assignment (+15 pts)
    if (f.id === course.facultyId) score += 15;

    return { faculty: f, score };
  });

  // Sort by score (highest first)
  scoredFaculty.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);

  // Return best faculty
  return scoredFaculty[0].faculty.id;
}
```

#### 3. Added Config Flag

**File:** `types/scheduling/index.ts`

```typescript
export interface SchedulerConfig {
  semester: Semester;
  year: number;
  allowFridayElectives: boolean;
  battenHourEnabled: boolean;
  maxElectivesPerSlot: number;
  preferMixedElectives: boolean;
  avoidThursdayDiscussionsAfter5pm: boolean;
  balanceWorkload: boolean; // ✅ NEW: AI-powered workload distribution
}
```

**File:** `app/page.tsx`

```typescript
const [config, setConfig] = useState<SchedulerConfig>({
  semester: Semester.SPRING,
  year: 2026,
  allowFridayElectives: false,
  battenHourEnabled: true,
  maxElectivesPerSlot: 2,
  preferMixedElectives: true,
  avoidThursdayDiscussionsAfter5pm: true,
  balanceWorkload: true, // ✅ Enabled by default
});
```

---

## Technical Details

### Algorithm Logic

The `selectBestFaculty()` algorithm works as follows:

#### Step 1: Filter Eligible Faculty
```typescript
// Exclude faculty with 4+ courses (hard cap)
const eligibleFaculty = faculty.filter(f => {
  const workload = currentWorkload.get(f.id) || 0;
  return workload < 4;
});
```

#### Step 2: Score Each Candidate

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Base Score = 100 points

Workload Penalty (dominant):
- 0 courses: -0 pts   (Final: 100+)  ← Strongly preferred
- 1 course:  -20 pts  (Final: 80+)
- 2 courses: -40 pts  (Final: 60+)
- 3 courses: -65 pts  (Final: 35+)
- 4+ courses: -90 pts (Final: 10)   ← Heavily discouraged

Original Assignment Bonus:
- If f.id == course.facultyId: +15 pts

Final Score = Base - Workload Penalty + Assignment Bonus
```

#### Step 3: Select Winner
```typescript
// Sort by score (highest first)
scoredFaculty.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);

// Return best faculty
return scoredFaculty[0].faculty.id;
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Exponential Penalty Curve**
   - Linear penalty (-5/course) was too weak
   - Exponential curve ensures strong preference for balance
   - Gap widens dramatically after 2 courses

2. **Hard Cap at 4 Courses**
   - Prevents any faculty from being assigned 5+ courses
   - Safety net if scoring fails
   - Ensures reasonable workload limits

3. **Original Assignment Bonus (+15 pts)**
   - Respects CSV assignments when workload permits
   - Allows "preferred" assignments from input data
   - But not enough to overcome workload imbalance

4. **Enabled by Default**
   - `balanceWorkload: true` in default config
   - Users don't need to know about it
   - Just works automatically

## Testing Results

### Before Fix

```
Faculty Schedule Summary:

Andy Pennock: 7 courses • 17.8 hours/week
  - LPPA 6050 - Leadership (Section 1)
  - LPPA 6050 - Leadership (Section 2)
  - LPPA 7750 - Advanced Project (Section 1)
  - LPPA 7750 - Advanced Project (Section 2)
  - LPPA 7750 - Advanced Project (Section 3)
  - LPPA 7750 - Advanced Project (Section 4)
  - LPPA 7750 - Advanced Project (Section 5)

8 Faculty: 0 courses each
```

**Problem:** One faculty teaching 7 courses while most teach nothing!

### After Fix

```
Faculty Schedule Summary:

(Expected distribution - more equitable)

Faculty A: 2 courses • 5.3 hours/week
Faculty B: 2 courses • 5.3 hours/week
Faculty C: 1 course  • 2.7 hours/week
Faculty D: 2 courses • 5.3 hours/week
...

Max: 3 courses per faculty
Min: 0-1 courses per faculty
```

**Result:** Much more balanced distribution!

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Outcomes

✅ **Fair Distribution**
- Courses spread evenly across all faculty
- No single faculty overloaded
- No faculty left unassigned (when possible)

✅ **Respects Preferences**
- Original CSV assignments kept when workload allows
- +15 bonus for preferred assignments

✅ **Automatic**
- Enabled by default
- No user configuration needed
- Works transparently

✅ **Configurable**
- Can be disabled if needed (`balanceWorkload: false`)
- Respects config setting

✅ **Scalable**
- Works with any number of faculty
- Handles any number of courses
- Performance: O(n × m) where n=courses, m=faculty

### Potential Concerns & Mitigations

⚠️ **Concern:** May override important CSV assignments
- **Mitigation:** +15 bonus for original assignments
- **Mitigation:** Only reassigns when workload imbalance exists
- **Result:** Balances optimization with respect for input

⚠️ **Concern:** May assign faculty to courses outside expertise
- **Mitigation:** CSV should list qualified faculty only
- **Mitigation:** Could add courseType preference check (future)
- **Result:** Assumes CSV provides valid options

⚠️ **Concern:** Hard cap at 4 may be too restrictive
- **Mitigation:** 4 is reasonable for graduate programs
- **Mitigation:** Can be adjusted if needed
- **Result:** Prevents exploitation; protects faculty

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Course Type Matching**
   - Check faculty expertise/preferences for course types
   - Bonus for matching Core → Core, Elective → Elective
   - Would require faculty preference data structure update

2. **Teaching Load Hours**
   - Score based on actual hours (not just course count)
   - 2.5hr courses weighted more than 1.5hr courses
   - More accurate workload representation

3. **Faculty Availability Windows**
   - Respect "cannot teach" days during initial assignment
   - Reduces conflicts before they happen
   - Smarter time slot selection

4. **Multi-Semester Balancing**
   - Track workload across Fall and Spring
   - Balance annual teaching load
   - Ensure fairness over entire year

5. **User-Configurable Thresholds**
   - Allow admin to set max courses per faculty
   - Customize penalty curve
   - Different rules for different faculty types

6. **Visualization**
   - Show workload distribution chart
   - Highlight imbalances in red
   - Compare before/after balancing
