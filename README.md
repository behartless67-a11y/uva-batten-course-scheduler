An automated course scheduling application for the UVA Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. This tool uses constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) algorithms with greedy fallback to generate optimal course schedules while respecting faculty preferences, room constraints, and student cohort requirements.

**Built for:** Heather and the UVA Batten Course Scheduling Team
**Developed:** October 2025
**Status:** Production Ready

## Features

### Core Scheduling Engine

- **Automated Schedule Generation**: CSP-based algorithm that automatically assigns time slots and rooms
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Enforces hard and soft constraints including:
  - Faculty availability and preferences
  - Room capacity and priority assignment (Dell â†’ Rouss â†’ Pavilion VIII)
  - Student cohort conflicts
  - Batten Hour protection (Monday 12:30-1:30)
  - Core course distribution (morning/afternoon offerings)
  - Parenting partner considerations
  - Elective distribution limits

- **Smart File Upload**: Import faculty preferences and course data from Excel/CSV files
  - Intelligent column matching (handles variations in column names)
  - Support for both .xlsx and .csv formats
  - Validation and error reporting

- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection and visualization of scheduling conflicts
- **Multiple Views**: Grid (calendar) and list views for schedule visualization
- **Search & Filter**: Filter by course level, search by course code or faculty name
- **Export Functionality**: Export schedules and conflicts to Excel

### Faculty Preference Collection System ðŸ†•

- **Online Submission Form** (`/faculty-submit`): Faculty can submit teaching preferences remotely
  - Preferred teaching days
  - Days they cannot teach
  - Time slot preferences
  - Parenting partner information
  - Additional notes and constraints

- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`): Manage all faculty submissions
  - View all submissions in sortable table
  - Search and filter by faculty name or email
  - Export to Excel with one click
  - Delete outdated submissions
  - Real-time data refresh

- **Flexible Storage**:
  - Mock storage for local development (no setup required)
  - Azure Table Storage integration for production (optional)

ðŸ“– **See [FACULTY_SUBMISSION_SETUP.md](FACULTY_SUBMISSION_SETUP.md) for detailed setup guide**

   - `targetPrograms`: Target student programs (optional)
   - `notes`: Additional notes (optional)

### Step 2: Configure Settings

- Set maximum electives per time slot
- Enable/disable Friday electives
- Configure Batten Hour enforcement
- Set preference for mixed electives (undergrad + grad)

### Step 3: Generate & View Schedule

- Click "Generate Schedule" to run the CSP algorithm
- View conflicts in the Conflict Panel
- Switch between Grid and List views
- Search and filter courses
- Export schedule and conflicts to Excel

## Scheduling Constraints

### Hard Constraints (Must be satisfied)

1. **No Room Double Booking**: Rooms cannot be assigned to multiple sections at the same time
2. **No Faculty Double Booking**: Faculty cannot teach multiple sections at the same time
3. **Faculty Hard Constraints**: Faculty "cannot teach" days must be respected
4. **Student Cohort Conflicts**: Core courses for the same cohort cannot overlap
5. **Batten Hour**: No core courses during Monday 12:30-1:30
6. **Core Course Overlaps**: Undergraduate and graduate core courses cannot overlap within their levels
7. **Parenting Partner Conflicts**: Faculty who share parenting cannot be scheduled simultaneously

### Soft Constraints (Preferences)

1. **Faculty Preferences**: Preferred days and times (when possible)
2. **Elective Distribution**: Maximum 2 electives per time slot
3. **Mixed Electives**: Prefer 1 undergraduate + 1 graduate elective per slot
4. **Core Offerings**: Each core should have morning and afternoon sections
5. **Thursday Evenings**: Minimize discussion sections after 5pm on Thursday
6. **Friday Restrictions**: Avoid Friday electives unless explicitly allowed

### Room Assignment Priority

1. **Dell** (60 capacity): Large lectures, single-section core courses
2. **Rouss Hall** (48 capacity): Medium-sized courses, multi-section cores
3. **Pavilion VIII** (18 capacity): Small electives, capstones
4. **UREG Assigned**: Everything else (registrar assigns)

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS (UVA Batten styling)
- **xlsx**: Excel file parsing and export
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

## Algorithm Details

The scheduler uses a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** approach with:

- **Backtracking**: Systematically tries different time slot and room assignments
- **Forward Checking**: Prunes invalid assignments early
- **Constraint Propagation**: Detects conflicts before completion
- **Variable Ordering**: Schedules most constrained courses first (core courses, limited time slots)
- **Value Ordering**: Ranks time slots by faculty preference

## Future Enhancements

- Drag-and-drop schedule editing
- Manual override capabilities
- Database persistence (currently in-memory)
- Multi-user authentication
- Schedule version history
- Advanced optimization (minimize gaps, cluster courses by program)
- Integration with UVA SIS

## Algorithm Details

### Two-Phase Scheduling Approach

1. **Phase 1: CSP Backtracking (Primary)**
   - Variable ordering: Most constrained courses first (core > electives)
   - Value ordering: Faculty preference-ranked time slots
   - Forward checking: Prunes invalid assignments early
   - Constraint propagation: Detects conflicts before completion

2. **Phase 2: Greedy Fallback (If Phase 1 Fails)**
   - Schedules sections one by one
   - Takes first available slot that doesn't violate hard constraints
   - More lenient than backtracking - ignores some soft constraints
   - Guarantees partial schedule even with tight constraints

### Constraint Hierarchy

1. **Hard Constraints** (Never violated)
   - Room/faculty double booking
   - Faculty hard availability
   - Student cohort conflicts
   - Batten Hour protection

2. **Soft Constraints** (Honored when possible)
   - Faculty preferences
   - Elective distribution limits
   - Core morning/afternoon offerings
   - Parenting partner considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Schedule Generation Fails
- **Problem:** "Unable to generate schedule"
- **Solutions:**
  1. Enable Friday electives in configuration
  2. Increase max electives per slot
  3. Check faculty preferences for conflicts
  4. Reduce number of sections if possible

### Some Sections Not Scheduled
- **Problem:** Partial schedule (e.g., 17 of 26 sections)
- **Cause:** Insufficient time slots or too many conflicts
- **Solutions:**
  1. Review conflict panel for specific issues
  2. Adjust course durations (e.g., 80 min â†’ 75 min)
  3. Allow more flexibility in time preferences
  4. Manually assign problem courses after auto-generation

### File Upload Errors
- **Problem:** "Failed to parse files"
- **Solutions:**
  1. Ensure Excel/CSV files match template format exactly
  2. Check for special characters in faculty names
  3. Verify all required columns are present
  4. Use sample templates as reference

### Room Capacity Issues
- **Problem:** Enrollment exceeds room capacity
- **Solutions:**
  1. Increase room capacity in room definitions
  2. Split course into multiple sections
  3. Manually assign larger room in schedule viewer
