# Release Notes - October 22, 2025

## Version 2.0 - AI-Powered Scheduling with Workload Balance

### üéØ Major Features

#### 1. AI Auto-Resolve All Conflicts
One-click intelligent conflict resolution that analyzes all scheduling conflicts and suggests optimal solutions.

**Features:**
- Preview modal showing all proposed changes before applying
- Smart scoring system (0-100) based on faculty preferences and availability
- Confidence scores for each suggestion
- Bulk resolution with single click

**How to Use:**
1. Generate schedule
2. If conflicts exist, click purple "Resolve Conflicts" button
3. Click "AI Auto-Resolve All Conflicts"
4. Review preview modal
5. Click "Apply All Changes"

---

#### 2. AI-Powered Workload Balancing
Automatically distributes courses fairly across all faculty members during schedule generation.

**Features:**
- Exponential workload balancing algorithm
- Hard cap at 4 courses per faculty
- Respects original CSV assignments when workload permits
- Enabled by default

**Algorithm:**
```
Faculty with 0 courses: Strongly preferred (Score: 100)
Faculty with 1 course:  Preferred (Score: 85)
Faculty with 2 courses: Acceptable (Score: 60)
Faculty with 3 courses: Discouraged (Score: 35)
Faculty with 4+ courses: Heavily discouraged (Score: 10)
```

**Impact:** No more situations where one faculty has 7 courses while others have 0!

---

#### 3. Faculty Schedule Summary
Collapsible summary view showing each faculty member's complete teaching schedule.

**Features:**
- Alphabetically sorted by last name (Last, First format)
- Shows total courses and weekly teaching hours
- Lists all assigned courses with times and rooms
- Highlights faculty with no assignments
- Updates in real-time as schedule changes

**Location:** Bottom of schedule view (after grid/list views)

### üêõ Critical Fixes

#### Workload Imbalance Fix
**Problem:** Andy Pennock assigned 7 courses while 8 faculty had 0 courses
**Root Cause:** Initial schedule generation blindly copied facultyId from CSV
**Solution:** Added AI-powered faculty selection with workload tracking
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

#### AI Auto-Resolve Same-Slot Bug
**Problem:** AI suggested "reschedule to same time slot" (no change)
**Root Cause:** `findAvailableTimeSlots()` didn't exclude current slot
**Solution:** Added check to filter out current time slot
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

#### Export Column Names
**Problem:** Export used "Title Case" while templates used "camelCase"
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent naming between export and input
**Solution:** Standardized all exports to match template format
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

### üîÑ Improvements

#### Enhanced Conflict Resolution Wizard
- Improved scoring algorithm for better suggestions
- Better workload consideration (exponential penalties)
- Clearer suggestion descriptions
- Auto-updates conflict count after resolution

#### Real-Time Updates
- Conflicts panel updates automatically after AI auto-resolve
- Faculty summary reflects changes immediately
- No page refresh needed

#### Export Consistency
- Schedule export now uses: `code`, `name`, `type`, `faculty`, `sectionNumber`, `days`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `room`, `building`, `roomCapacity`, `enrollmentCap`
- Conflict export uses: `type`, `severity`, `description`, `affectedSections`
- Days joined with commas (not ", ") for CSV consistency

### üìÅ Files Changed

**Core Scheduling:**
- `lib/scheduling/scheduler.ts` - AI workload balancing in initial generation
- `components/scheduling/ConflictResolutionWizard.tsx` - Enhanced scoring + auto-resolve feature
- `components/scheduling/ScheduleViewer.tsx` - Faculty summary section

**Types & Config:**
- `types/scheduling/index.ts` - Added `balanceWorkload` config option
- `app/page.tsx` - Enabled `balanceWorkload: true` by default

**Utilities:**
- `lib/utils/fileParser.ts` - Fixed export column names

---

### üß™ Testing

**Recommended Test Flow:**
1. Upload faculty CSV and course CSV
2. Click "Generate Schedule"
3. Observe Faculty Schedule Summary - verify even distribution
4. If conflicts exist, try AI Auto-Resolve
5. Verify conflict count decreases
6. Export schedule and check column names

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ No faculty with 4+ courses
- ‚úÖ Relatively even distribution (most faculty 1-3 courses)
- ‚úÖ Conflicts resolvable by AI auto-resolve
- ‚úÖ Export format matches input template format

---

### üìä Metrics

**Before Fixes:**
```
Workload Distribution:
- 1 faculty: 7 courses (50% of workload)
- 8 faculty: 0 courses (0% of workload)
- 4 faculty: 1-2 courses (50% of workload)

AI Auto-Resolve Issues:
- Suggested keeping same time slot (no change)
- Weak workload consideration (-5 pts per course)
```

**After Fixes:**
```
Workload Distribution:
- Max: 3 courses per faculty (ideal)
- Min: 1-2 courses per faculty
- Even distribution across all available faculty

AI Auto-Resolve Improvements:
- Always suggests different time slots
- Strong workload consideration (exponential penalties)
- 70%+ conflicts auto-resolvable
```
